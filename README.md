# project2

This was a class project that features CSS and Javascript. 

The purpose was to take a poorly designed website and re-make portions of it. 

What I decided to do was add more functionality such as adding Bootstrap modals to feature sales, using accordions to better organize shipping and faq sections, and generally cleaning up large amounts of text.

For the Javascript portion, I decided to add in a calculator which calculates a price for an individual item based on quantity which is then displayed when the user selects a quantity per item. When the user clicks on the "Get Subtotal" button, all the prices of the individual items are added together, and a subtotal is displayed.

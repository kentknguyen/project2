                        Shipping costs are calculated by weight and distance from SW Colorado (our home base) to your desired shipping location. Your shipping cost is based on the weight of the meat you order, plus the tare weight of the shipping box with 1.5” poly foam liners plus the needed extra weight of dry ice or cold-gel packs to be added. We adjust the dry ice or gel packs to the expected destination’s ambient temperature to ensure that you receive your order in good condition.

                        The time it takes your package to reach you will depend on your location relative to ours, and which service provider we use to ship your order. We will estimate the costs of shipping using ground (or truck transport), two day airfreight and overnight express. Our possible carriers are the US Post Office, and United Parcel Service. Fed-Ex does not service our area very well. If at all possible and safe, we will try to use a ground service carrier giving you the cheapest transport possible.

                        We have negotiated special rates for overnight service and 2-day service particularly for the east and west coast. So even through the distances might be too far for judicious ground service, we can still make exceptional overnight deals. </div>

Once a preferred shipping option is agreed upon, your order is sent to our packing and shipping department for processing. Occasionally with a known customer, or an obvious shipping conclusion, we will ship without customer notification other than the carrier shipping notice sent via email when the package is labeled for shipment.

                        Our packing specialist will then assemble your order and the various specific cuts of, elk, deer of buffalo meat that you requested from our sub-zero freezers or for the jerky from our refrigerated facilities. Our frozen meat is stored at ten to twenty degrees below zero to ensure that you get the finest products possible. Buffalo and elk jerkies are stored at about 30 degrees to prolong shelf life. Your order is carefully packed in one of our special packing boxes, which contain 1.5” of foam insulation on all sides, plus poly peanuts to insulate and cushion the various products during transport. We have three sizes of boxes: a 12” cubic box hold up to about 13# of meat, a 14” box holds up to about 36# of meat, and lastly our 18” cubed box can hold upwards of 65# of meat, but we try not to exceed 70# due to the potential for lifting injuries. We will add some additional printed literature such as brochures, cooking tips or other items as indicated by your order. Once assembled, your package is then stored in the sub-zero freezers while the invoice and shipping labels are processed, awaiting courier pickup. When the invoice and shipping labels are complete, your card is credit card charged, and your receipt is attached to the invoice. Since individually packaged cuts of meat vary slightly in weight, the exact amount you receive may also vary slightly from the amount of meat you ordered, but calculated correctly based upon the costs per pound of each cut as found on the internet at www.ElkUSA.com. Exact meat weights to hundredths of pounds (i.e. 1.26 lbs of Elk chuck roast) will be reflected on your invoice, a copy of which is packed in the top of the box. The appropriate amount of dry ice or gel packs are added, based on the destination, time of year, how long your package has to travel and who is the courier. Straight ground transport is packed with dry ice, while air shipments will go with gel packs stored at -100 degrees. Your package is then sealed and returned to the sub-zero freezer to await pickup.</div>

IF A PROBLEM seems to be brewing give us a call immediately at 1-888-788-7441 and let us know and we will track it down and get some action done immediately. Generally, over 98% of our packages arrive on time! WE WILL GUARANTEE that the meat will arrive in safe condition although occasionally some thawing may be present,. but that will not affect meat quality. As long the as the meat is still cold (under 40 degrees F), just place the meat back in the freezer. Limited thawing and refreezing is not a meat safety issue. We have shipped items to all 50 states and while some of the Hawaii destinations take at least 5 days, we still made it in safe condition. Once you receive the package, please review the contents for temperature and the correct amounts compared to your invoice. If you find any problems please contact us immediately at 1-888-788-7441. ….otherwise we hope that you enjoy our delicious Elk, buffalo and deer meat products! Thank you for your meat order.

                        Frequently, shipping cost can be a significant part of any frozen meat order. As your chosen meat supplier, we have costs for both the shipping materials (box, foam, dry ice or gel-cold packs) and the courier service such as UPS or the US Post Office so as to get it delivered. Our philosophy is to find for our customers the most effective shipping method at the least cost as necessary FOR THEIR INDIVIDUAL SITUATION. Hence we will call you to to discuss the shipping options available and to confirm your credit card number.

                        As you may have noticed, unlike many internet companies, we don't spend a lot of money on fancy website pictures, bells and whistles .... we just offer our products cheaper!

                        We don't automatically calculate your shipping cost on the computer order form because many, many variables are present with each and every shipment of frozen meat around our wonderful country. Your location, the time of year, the weight of the box, the weather, a rural verses sub-urban verses an urban delivery area, dry ice regulations verses gel pack effectiveness, etc. We seek to find the lowest possible rate to ship your order, together with safety of the meat transport so as to determine the final shipping method and cost. THIS WILL SAVE YOU AND US Many POTENTIAL PROBLEMS and money. Rest assured, we don't make any money on the shipping end of our business.

                        Some wonder why we don't just offer a flat rate shipping cost or a NO SHIPPING COST deal. Well, because those "DEALS" cost money, one way or another and our goal is to make the meat affordable for all parties, right here at the ranch store or out there on the Internet. Since we are located in rural Colorado, why should a person in central Maine, 2000 miles away, get the same price for shipping as someone in downtown Denver 200 miles away? Somebody is going to be subsidizing the FREE SHIPPING somewhere.

                        Soooo .... while we have no great "shipping deals" (thereby saving you a considerable hidden cost) OUR MEAT PRICES ARE JUST BETTER THAN MOST plus, we just have more experience in getting our products to your door with the least amount of cost and hassle!

                        Thank you for your consideration.

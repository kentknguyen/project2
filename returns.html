                            <li>ElkUSA.com ships both frozen and non-frozen products. Non-frozen, non-perishable products can be returned to ElkUSA.com via US postal service or ground UPS.

                            <li>If frozen product is to be returned, the packaging and timing of shipment is critical to the return of a wholesome product. ElkUSA.com makes every effort to ship a wholesome product that will arrive at the customer in frozen or well-chilled condition. Partial or even complete thawing will not affect the wholesomeness or quality of the product, particularly if the internal box temperature does not exceed 40 degrees F. Simply place in a refrigerator and use within 3 days, or just refreeze the product. Any return will be held to a similar conditional standard.

                        In the rare event that a shipping problem has occured with your product shipment and that problem materially affects the contents of the shipment, you must contact ElkUSA.com immediately upon receipt for a frozen product and within 48 hours on a non-frozen product. Contact can be made via email to: Grandemeats@gmail.com or via toll-free phone number 888-338-4581. A failure to timely inform ElkUSA of a problem shall deem the products to be acceptably delivered.

If the error was yours, we may charge you an extra $12 to $17 for the address change. This covers the correction charge made to us by the shipping contractor. If we made the error, then we will stand by our pledge to get your product delivered on time and keep your product wholesome.
